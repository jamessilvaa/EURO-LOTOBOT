<analysis>
The previous AI engineer initiated the development of a futuristic lottery prediction web application for paid users. The trajectory shows a phased approach starting from environment setup and requirements gathering. A key decision was to defer payment gateway implementation (Stripe was dropped in favor of Kiwify, meaning no direct payment integration was needed from the AI engineer). The engineer focused on establishing the core application structure (FastAPI backend, React frontend) and integrating essential dependencies like  for LLM capabilities (Gemini, Groq) and machine learning libraries (scikit-learn, pandas, numpy) for the LSTM model. The engineer performed an initial bulk file write for , , and , and confirmed backend service startup and basic API responsiveness. While the AI engineer indicated the task was finished after this initial setup, implying the first successful value addition, significant core features such as the LSTM prediction logic, user authentication, subscription management, and admin functionalities remain to be implemented.

<product_requirements>
The user requires a futuristic web application, reminiscent of AI, in Brazilian Portuguese and Spanish, to help users predict lottery numbers for Euromillones, La Primitiva, and El Gordo. The application is exclusively for paying users, requiring a login page. Admin access is necessary to manage users, subscriptions, and generate/revoke user access, with a single subscription plan. An admin token (EUROADMIN252024@) is specified for access. The core functionality must involve an LSTM training model to improve lottery number prediction. Integration with Google Gemini and Groq APIs is required, with API keys provided. The payment system will be handled externally by Kiwify, so no direct Stripe integration is needed.

**Detailed Directory structure:**


-   **/app/backend/server.py**:
    -   **Summary of why this file is important**: This is the core of the FastAPI backend application. It handles API routes, business logic, and interactions with the database and external services (LLMs, ML models).
    -   **Summary of the changes made to this file, if any**: This file was completely rewritten in the initial bulk write (Chat Message 13) to establish the basic FastAPI application structure, likely including CORS handling and initial routes. It would also be the place for LLM integration and LSTM prediction logic.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**:
    -   **Summary of why this file is important**: This is the main React component that renders the primary user interface of the application.
    -   **Summary of the changes made to this file, if any**: This file was completely rewritten in the initial bulk write (Chat Message 13) to establish the base UI and integrate with the backend, potentially including basic routing or page structure.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.css**:
    -   **Summary of why this file is important**: This file contains the main CSS styles for the  component, likely utilizing Tailwind CSS for styling.
    -   **Summary of the changes made to this file, if any**: This file was completely rewritten in the initial bulk write (Chat Message 13) to provide foundational styling for the application's UI.
-   **/app/backend/requirements.txt**:
    -   **Summary of why this file is important**: Lists all Python dependencies required for the backend, ensuring consistent environment setup.
    -   **Summary of the changes made to this file, if any**: Updated to include , , , and  (Chat Message 19).
-   **/app/frontend/package.json**:
    -   **Summary of why this file is important**: Defines Node.js project metadata and lists JavaScript dependencies for the frontend.
    -   **Summary of the changes made to this file, if any**: Not explicitly shown as modified in the trajectory, but implicitly updated during the initial frontend setup to include React and Tailwind dependencies.

<current_work>
The application's foundational structure has been laid out. The AI engineer has performed an initial bulk write, creating the core FastAPI backend () and React frontend (, ) files. Essential Python dependencies for machine learning (, , ) and LLM integration () have been installed and added to . The backend service is confirmed to be running and accessible, with a basic  endpoint successfully tested. User-provided API keys for Google Gemini and Groq have been received. The current state represents the initial 0 to 1 build, where the basic environment and communication channels are established, and the system is ready for the implementation of core features. The AI engineer considered this initial setup and basic API responsiveness as the first successful value addition.
